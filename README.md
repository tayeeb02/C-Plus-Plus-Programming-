HKUST University C++ Programming Assignments

**PA1:** A mini 2D rpg game, the primary objective of the game is to overcome obstacles and reach specific destinations within a defined boundary as desired by the user. 
Uses basic principles of C++ coding and for loops.

**PA2:** The provided program is designed to solve the L-shape blocks problem which uses the concept of recursion. The problem involves a 2^N x 2^N array, where N can be either 1, 2, or 3. The array represents a grid, and the goal is to fill all the cells of the grid except for one designated empty cell with non-overlapping L-shape blocks.
The program takes several inputs:

    1. The 2^N x 2^N array itself.
    2. The coordinates (x, y) of the empty cell within the array.
    3. The legal range of coordinates for the empty cell, which depends on the size of the array. For a 2 x 2 block, the legal range is 0-1; for a 4 x 4 block, the legal range is 0-3; and for an 8 x 8 block, the legal range is 0-7. These ranges define the valid positions for the empty cell.

The output of the program is the arrangement of L-shape blocks in the array, with the empty cell remaining empty. The program offers two output modes:

    1. Console output without normalization: In this mode, the program displays the resulting array on the console without any normalization or adjustments.
    2. Console output with normalization: In this mode, the program normalizes or adjusts the resulting array, if necessary, to ensure consistent formatting or spacing, and then displays it on the console.

 **PA3:** A Simplified version of USTSpace, where students can give reviews to courses, add star rankings, delete star rankings. This assignment is programmed by using the concept
of structs, pointer arithmetic, linked lists, binary search tree algorithm.
